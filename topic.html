In order to pursue the career of journalism, you have to obtain a bachelors 
degree, as well as in the communication and/or journalism field.  The salary is 
about forty thousand annually, depending on which field you take.  Computer science is

Journalism can be pursued in many different fields.  For example, there are people who write 
columns for newspapers and/or magazines.  Then there are others who have their own websites or 
blogs where they realy do need CSS to design their web page.  There are also journalists that
travel and pick specific topics to research and creatively write upon.  That is the route I would 
like to pursue.
